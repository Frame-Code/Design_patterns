### DESIGN PATTERNS EXPLANATION
This is a simple java project with the design patterns I'm learning.
**Each project has the respective detailed explanation in comments code.** 
For now, just four creational patterns:
- Builder
- Singleton
- Prototype
- Factory method

Over time, I will add more design patterns as I learn them.
